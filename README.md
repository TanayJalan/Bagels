# Bagels – A Deductive Logic Game

Bagels is a classic number-guessing puzzle where the player attempts to guess a secret 3-digit number with no repeating digits. After each guess, the game provides clues to help the player deduce the correct number:

- **Fermi** – One digit is correct and in the right position  
- **Pico** – One digit is correct but in the wrong position  
- **Bagel** – No digits match the secret number  

The player must use logic, deduction, and pattern recognition to identify the hidden number within the allowed number of guesses.
